## Description
Being a web developer means being part of a community. I'll need a place to share my projects not only if I am applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

Now that I've completed multiple projects, I am creating a portfolio, using my new React skills to help set my apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

Just as I did many practice projects, I’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages.


User Story
- AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- WHEN I load the portfolio
- THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- WHEN I view the header
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- WHEN I view the navigation titles
- THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title
- THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
- THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
- THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
- THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
- THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
- THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field
- THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
- THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- WHEN I view the footer
- THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
