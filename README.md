## Description
Being a web developer means being part of a community. I'll need a place to share my projects not only if I am applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

Now that I've completed multiple projects, I am creating a portfolio, using my new React skills to help set my apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

Just as I did many practice projects, I deployed this application to GitHub Pages.
